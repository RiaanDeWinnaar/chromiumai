# Overview  
ChromiumAI is a true Chromium fork with invisible AI integration, designed to outperform Perplexity Comet through GAIA-optimized agent swarm capabilities. Unlike AI browser wrappers, ChromiumAI maintains 100% Chromium compatibility while adding a 1% AI integration layer that provides native AI browsing capabilities through chrome://ai-browser/ WebUI and API interception patterns.

The product targets developers, researchers, and power users who need AI-native browsing capabilities without sacrificing the reliability and performance of standard Chromium. ChromiumAI specifically targets GAIA benchmark leadership with >90% overall accuracy across all complexity levels.

# Core Features  
**True Chromium Fork**: Maintains 99% unchanged Chromium functionality with invisible AI integration that preserves all existing browser capabilities and user experience.

**ACP Agent Swarm**: IBM's Agent Communication Protocol enables coordinated multi-agent problem solving with specialized agents for different GAIA complexity levels (Level 1: quick reasoning, Level 2: multi-step research, Level 3: complex analysis).

**chrome://ai-browser/ WebUI**: Native browser interface for AI configuration, agent monitoring, and direct AI interaction without disrupting normal browsing workflows.

**API Interception Service**: Localhost service (port 3456) that intercepts AI API calls and routes them through the optimized agent swarm, enabling seamless integration with existing AI tools and workflows.

**GAIA Benchmark Optimization**: Architecture specifically designed to excel at GAIA benchmark tasks with target accuracies of >95% Level 1, >90% Level 2, >80% Level 3.

**Automated Chromium Upgrades**: Automated merge pipeline for maintaining compatibility with upstream Chromium releases while preserving AI integration features.

# User Experience  
**Primary User Personas**:
- AI Researchers needing reliable AI-native browsing for research workflows
- Developers building AI applications who need consistent AI API performance  
- Power users wanting invisible AI assistance without browser switching

**Key User Flows**:
1. Normal browsing experience identical to Chromium with zero learning curve
2. Optional AI activation via chrome://ai-browser/ for configuration and monitoring
3. Transparent AI enhancement of browsing tasks through API interception
4. Direct AI interaction through WebUI when needed for complex tasks

**UI/UX Considerations**:
- Zero disruption to existing Chromium user experience
- AI features discoverable but not intrusive
- Performance metrics and agent status visible for power users
- One-click AI configuration and provider management
