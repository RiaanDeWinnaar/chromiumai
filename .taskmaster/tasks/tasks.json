        "description": "Create true Chromium fork with minimal WebUI registration for chrome://ai-browser/ protocol",
        "details": "Fork upstream Chromium repository using git subtree strategy. Implement minimal WebUI registration in Chromium's content/browser/webui directory to handle chrome://ai-browser/ protocol. Create basic WebUIController and WebUIDataSource classes. Configure build system to include new WebUI components. Ensure 99% Chromium functionality preservation.\n<info added on 2025-09-18T13:54:13.379Z>\nBased on the research session findings, here are key implementation details and best practices that should be incorporated:\n\n**Repository Strategy**: Use git subtree with upstream-chromium remote for single-repo approach. Keep ai-related code outside chromium/ subtree to avoid merge conflicts. Command pattern: `git remote add upstream-chromium https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git` followed by `git subtree add --prefix=chromium upstream-chromium main --squash` for initial setup and `git subtree pull --prefix=chromium upstream-chromium main --squash` for updates.\n\n**Minimal-Diff Principle**: Register new WebUI via additive code in dedicated directories (chrome/browser/ui/webui/ai_browser/). Avoid editing core Chromium files. Use feature flag guard with `base::FeatureList::IsEnabled(kAIBrowserWebUI)` for runtime safety and regression prevention.\n\n**Build System Integration**: Create BUILD.gn file in chrome/browser/ui/webui/ai_browser/ with source_set dependencies on //content/public/browser, //ui/base, and //chrome/browser. Use GN args overlays for platform-specific configurations with shared baseline: is_component_build=true, enable_nacl=false, blink_symbol_level=0, symbol_level=1.\n\n**WebUI Controller Implementation**: Extend ChromeWebUIControllerFactory::GetWebUIFactoryFunction with conditional for ai-browser host. Implement AIBrowserUI class inheriting content::WebUIController with CreateDataSource method for resource packaging via grit system.\n\n**Development Mode Support**: Enable conditional loading from FastAPI service at http://localhost:3456 for development with --allow-insecure-localhost flag. Production uses embedded resources through WebUIDataSource with IDR_AI_BROWSER_INDEX_HTML resource ID.\n\n**Testing Framework**: Add browser test using content_browsertests harness with IN_PROC_BROWSER_TEST_F to verify chrome://ai-browser/ loads successfully with HTTP 200 status and no console errors. Include core test shards validation to confirm no Chromium functionality regressions.\n\n**Patch Management**: Maintain quilt-style or git-format-patch series for isolated changes. Each patch should have single responsibility: URL scheme registration, WebUI bundle inclusion, permission adjustments. Enforce pre-push script to ensure only expected directories are modified.\n</info added on 2025-09-18T13:54:13.379Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-18T14:16:56.119Z>\n**Detailed WebUI Implementation Guide**: Based on comprehensive research findings, here are specific implementation patterns for the chrome://ai-browser/ WebUI registration:\n\n**Core WebUIController Implementation Pattern**: Create AiBrowserUI class in content/browser/webui/ai_browser_ui.h inheriting from content::WebUIController. The constructor should call content::WebUIDataSource::Create(chrome::kAiBrowserHost) and configure resource paths using AddResourcePath() for JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files. Use SetDefaultResource(IDR_AI_BROWSER_HTML) for the main page resource.\n\n**Protocol Registration in ChromeWebUIControllerFactory**: Modify chrome/browser/ui/webui/chrome_web_ui_controller_factory.cc by adding conditional logic in CreateWebUIControllerForURL() method to check for url.host() == chrome::kAiBrowserHost and return new AiBrowserUI(web_ui). This ensures proper routing to the custom WebUI controller.\n\n**BUILD.gn Integration Strategy**: Create source_set(\"webui\") in content/browser/webui/BUILD.gn with sources listing ai_browser_ui.cc/h files and dependencies on //base, //content/public/browser, and //ui/base. Ensure proper dependency chains to support the agent monitoring dashboard components.\n\n**GRIT Resource System Configuration**: Define resource IDs in appropriate .grd files using include elements with names like IDR_AI_BROWSER_HTML, IDR_AI_BROWSER_JS, and IDR_AI_BROWSER_CSS. Set type=\"BINDATA\" for proper binary resource handling. The GRIT system will generate resource headers that WebUIDataSource references for serving static assets.\n\n**Isolated Implementation for Minimal Fork Strategy**: Place all AI browser code in dedicated chrome/browser/ui/webui/ai_browser/ subdirectory to avoid core Chromium file modifications. Use feature flags with base::FeatureList::IsEnabled(kAIBrowserWebUI) for conditional compilation. Implement proper ifdef guards around protocol registration to maintain 99% Chromium functionality preservation requirement.\n\n**Message Handler Integration**: Add web_ui->AddMessageHandler(std::make_unique<AiBrowserMessageHandler>()) in the WebUIController constructor to enable JavaScript-C++ communication for agent monitoring and configuration interfaces. This supports the real-time agent status visualization and configuration persistence features outlined in related tasks.\n</info added on 2025-09-18T14:16:56.119Z>",

Full Chromium repository contains 1,638,488 commits across 35,725 tags with massive binary assets. The git subtree strategy remains valid with shallow clone approach, enabling faster baseline establishment while preserving all current source code needed for fork development.\n</info added on 2025-09-18T13:58:31.707Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-18T15:13:23.673Z>\nEnhanced approach with shallow clone optimization: Use git clone --depth 1 --no-single-branch to reduce repository size from 20GB to 2-3GB. Implement sparse checkout targeting WebUI components to maintain ~5GB working directory. Configure depot_tools with gclient sync --no-history --shallow --no-hooks for minimal dependencies. Alternative Content Shell development path available for faster iteration cycles. Build optimization includes component builds (is_component_build = true), ccache integration (CCACHE_MAXSIZE=20G), and platform-specific targeting. Docker containerization recommended for consistent cross-platform builds with IDE exclusion of out/, third_party/, .git/ directories.\n</info added on 2025-09-18T15:13:23.673Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-19T00:37:13.538Z>\nIMPLEMENTATION PIVOT: The direct Chromium clone/subtree approach is abandoned due to persistent network failures (RPC failed, curl 56) and prohibitive download times. The new strategy is to use Electron as the Chromium-based browser foundation. The `chrome://ai-browser/` protocol will be implemented using Electron's `protocol.registerHttpProtocol`, bridging to a local FastAPI service on `localhost:3456`. This change unblocks development by avoiding the massive repository download while preserving full WebUI capabilities and enabling a faster development cycle. A minimal Chromium Content Shell build will be used as a fallback if Electron proves insufficient. Proceeding immediately with the Electron-based implementation.\n</info added on 2025-09-19T00:37:13.538Z>",

The model should enforce immutability where appropriate and include strict typing with validation.\n\n**Agent Base Class Architecture:**\nThe BaseAgent class should implement these core methods: process_message(msg) for incoming message handling, send_message(target, content, type, metadata) for outbound communication, handle_request(request) for synchronous request processing. Include agent_id, agent_type properties, inbox message queue for async processing, logging hooks for debugging, capability registry stub for service discovery, and integration with the serialization validation layer.\n\n**Message Routing Infrastructure:**\nImplement InMemoryRouter with register_agent/unregister_agent methods for agent lifecycle management, route(message) for message dispatch with error handling, support for direct addressing and optional broadcast capabilities, correlation tracking for request-response patterns, basic async queue handling with configurable timeouts, and error propagation semantics that return structured error messages to senders when routing fails.\n\n**Protocol Compliance Framework:**\nAdd protocol constants including version identifiers, standard message types, and error codes. Implement compliance validation checks for mandatory headers, version negotiation capabilities, and structured error message construction. Provide extensibility hooks for future runtime integration with distributed messaging systems while maintaining backward compatibility.\n\n**Serialization and Validation Layer:**\nImplement robust JSON serialization with to_json/from_json methods including strict field validation, enum constraint checking, timestamp format validation, and structured error codes for validation failures. Design for extensibility to support additional message types and protocols without breaking existing implementations.\n\n**Testing Strategy Enhancement:**\nInclude comprehensive test coverage for model instantiation with valid/invalid data, enum constraint validation, serialization round-trip equality testing, validation failure scenarios with proper error messages, BaseAgent method override patterns, message routing between mock agents with latency measurement, correlation ID handling for request-response cycles, protocol compliance validation, and edge cases like unknown message types and invalid receiver addresses.\n</info added on 2025-09-18T13:59:33.677Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-18T14:20:23.693Z>\n**GAIA-Specific Agent Communication Patterns:**\nImplement specialized message content structures for GAIA benchmark requirements. Planning Agent messages should include content.gaia_complexity_level (1, 2, or 3), content.reasoning_requirements, and content.expected_response_format fields. Level 1, 2, and 3 reasoning agents must include content.confidence_score and content.reasoning_trace in response messages to enable Planning Agent routing decisions.\n\n**Performance-Optimized Message Queue System:**\nIntegrate asyncio queues within FastAPI service architecture to support <100ms p95 latency requirement for Level 1 tasks. Implement non-blocking message processing with priority queuing based on GAIA complexity levels. Add message batching capabilities for Level 2 and Level 3 agents handling multi-step reasoning tasks.\n\n**Enhanced Message Model with GAIA Extensions:**\nExtend ACPMessage with priority field (1-10 scale) and ttl (time-to-live) field for timeout management. Add MessageType.HEARTBEAT for agent health monitoring integration with FastAPI /health endpoint. Include content.api_compatibility_layer metadata for Anthropic API translation in API Interceptor agent.\n\n**Production-Ready Error Handling Framework:**\nImplement comprehensive error codes in message content including AGENT_UNRESPONSIVE, ROUTING_FAILURE, VALIDATION_ERROR, and GAIA_COMPLEXITY_MISMATCH. Add circuit breaker pattern for automatic failure detection and recovery of unresponsive agents. Include structured error reporting for debugging agent interactions during GAIA benchmark execution.\n\n**Security and Authentication Layer:**\nDesign message signing capabilities framework for production deployments (deferred for initial development). Add agent authentication tokens in message headers for secure agent-to-agent communication. Implement message integrity validation to prevent tampering during agent swarm coordination.\n</info added on 2025-09-18T14:20:23.693Z>",

Create message queue system for asynchronous agent communication. Add basic error handling and timeout management for agent interactions.\n<info added on 2025-09-18T14:22:00.795Z>\nBased on the research findings, the ACP Runtime implementation should adopt a hub-and-spoke architecture with the ACPRuntime class serving as the central coordinator. Key architectural enhancements include implementing a two-phase agent registration process with capability validation, supporting both pull-based registry queries and push-based event notifications for agent discovery. The message routing system should incorporate a multi-tier queue architecture with separate queues for high-priority system messages, agent-to-agent communication, and broadcast notifications, plus intelligent routing that considers agent load and capabilities with circuit breaker patterns for failure handling.\n\nHealth monitoring should implement adaptive heartbeat intervals (5-second for critical planning orchestrator, 15-second for reasoning agents) with comprehensive metrics including processing latency, resource utilization, error rates, and queue depths. The timeout strategy requires cascading timeouts: 100-500ms for acknowledgments, 1-30 seconds for GAIA task processing, and exponential backoff for agent responses. Error recovery should include automatic retry mechanisms, agent restart procedures, and fallback routing.\n\nThe graceful shutdown procedure should implement a four-phase process: preparation (stop new requests), drain (complete in-flight messages), cleanup (persist states and queues), and termination (force-stop unresponsive components). State persistence capabilities are essential to allow seamless runtime resumption after restart, particularly important for long-running GAIA benchmark evaluations. Integration points include FastAPI health endpoints for runtime monitoring, WebUI real-time updates, and transparent request queuing for the Anthropic API compatibility layer while maintaining API timeout and response format consistency.\n</info added on 2025-09-18T14:22:00.795Z>",

Implement hub-and-spoke coordination pattern where PlanningAgent serves as central coordinator through ACPRuntime, with support for both pipeline coordination (sequential processing with rollback mechanisms) and parallel processing coordination for independent sub-tasks.

The benchmark execution engine should implement a hub-and-spoke architecture similar to Task 4's ACP Runtime, with the runner serving as central coordinator for task distribution to specialized agents (Level 1-3). Performance tracking should extend the ACP message structure from Task 3 to include agent_path tracking showing which agents handled each task, enabling analysis of optimal agent combinations per complexity level. Storage design should use time-series database approach for temporal analysis of agent swarm optimization over time. The adaptive optimization engine should provide agent configuration tuning recommendations including optimal timeout values, memory allocation based on task types, and concurrency settings for maximum throughput. Implementation should follow three-phase approach: Phase 1 focuses on core infrastructure integration with existing FastAPI service and ACP routing, Phase 2 adds comprehensive metrics and WebUI integration, Phase 3 implements the AI-powered recommendation system for configuration optimization.\n</info added on 2025-09-18T14:32:16.206Z>",
